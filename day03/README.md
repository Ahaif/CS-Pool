      - restart tor
      - sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname to show your .onion URL**
  - install nginx
    - modify .conf file in /etc/nginx/ 
    - add site.onion.conf to sites-available directory in nginx, make sure .conf file is linked with sites enabled
- restart services and you can access to default nginx page in [localhost:80](http://localhost:80) or
